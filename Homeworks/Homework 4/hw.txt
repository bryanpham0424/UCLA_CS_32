For primitive types such as int and double, the comparison operators has been overloaded to compare the data types
and their values. However, the Coord class does not define an overload for any of the comparison operators, and inside
the insert function's for loop, it compares the current "key" value which is a Coord object, which can't be compared, 
therefor resulting in a compiler error.
